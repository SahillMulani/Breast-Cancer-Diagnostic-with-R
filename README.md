# Diagnosing breast cancer with the kNN algorithm

Routine breast cancer screening allows the disease to be diagnosed and treated prior to it causing noticeable symptoms. The process of early detection involves examining the breast tissue for abnormal lumps or masses. If a lump is found, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy is performed, which utilizes a hollow needle to extract a small portion of cells from the mass. A clinician then examines the cells under a microscope to determine whether the mass is likely to be malignant or benign.
We will investigate the utility of machine learning for detecting cancer by applying the kNN algorithm to measurements of biopsied cells from women with abnormal breast masses.
